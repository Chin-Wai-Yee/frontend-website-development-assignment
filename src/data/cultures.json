      "The Chinese New Year, a significant celebration for the Chinese community in Malaysia, has its roots in ancient legend. According to one story, a monster named Nian would terrorize villagers at the start of each new year. To ward off the monster, people discovered that it was afraid of loud noises, bright lights, and the color red. As a result, traditions for the Chinese New Year often include fireworks, firecrackers, and wearing red clothing and decorations. Additionally, it is customary to give young people money in red envelopes to bring luck and prosperity for the upcoming year."

      "The Mid-Autumn Festival, as per a widely known legend in modern China, commemorates Qu Yuan, a poet and minister from the Chu state during the Warring States period of the Zhou dynasty. Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River out of despair, prompting locals to rush out in boats to rescue him or retrieve his body. This event is said to have led to the tradition of dragon boat races. Unable to find his body, they threw sticky rice balls into the river, hoping that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's remains. This is believed to be the origin of zongzi, a traditional food associated with the festival."
